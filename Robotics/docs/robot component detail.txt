Image Provider:
Provides: A bitmap of the world.
(An implementation of this module is target specific.)

Transmitter implementation:
Provides: A caller method which receives simple direction instructions (forward, turn x degrees, etc).
Transmits commands based on reveived instructions.
(An implementation of this module is target specific.)

Robot System:
Required interface: Image Provider
Required interface: Transmitter implementation
Makes direction instructions based on bitmap.

OpenCV:
Required interface: Image provider
Receives a bitmap of the world.
Does shape recognition on said bitmap.
Projects result into a matrix.
Calculates unit - cenitmeters ratio based on robot-shape.
Provides: Data structure containing size ratio and the matrix.

Controller main-component:
Required interface: OpenCV
Required interface: Transmitter implementation
Makes direction instructions based on the matrix

Route Plan:
Required interface: OpenCV
Calculates intercepting course from robot-shape to box-shape.
Calculates course from box-shape to target-shape.
Provides: 

Controller sub-module:
Required interface: Route Plan
Required interface: Transmitter implemenatation
Transforms route based on 'box-pushing' technic.
Invokes the transmitter implementation with direction instruction.
